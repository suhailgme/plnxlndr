# plnxlndr
A cryptocurrency lending bot for the Poloniex market/platform (Work in Progress).

Plnxlndr uses Poloniex's API to retrieve lending market data and offer loans autonomously. The rate at which to offer a loan is determined using moving averages and basic statistical analysis. The default lending strategy is not overly aggressive or passive and aims to secure loans with above average rates, while avoiding sudden dips in lending rates.
